Social network developed with NodeJS, MongoDB and Socket.IO . It's similar to twitter but i added a global live chat.
I made this SN bc my highschool requested it

    I dont recommend using it because it has weird code and some vulnerabilities.
    I decided to plublish it because my followers wanted to see how i coded in my first programming project.
